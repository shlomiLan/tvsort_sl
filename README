-  Initial run
	First you need to set the path of the main 3 folders and the KODI IP (if needed):
	- TV_PATH => folder for all TV-Shows, each show will be in a separate folder
    - MOVIES_PATH => folder for all NON TV-Shows files, all files will be in the same directory
    - UNSORTED_PATH => origin folder that contains all files that needs to be sorted
    - KODI_IP (optional) => IP for the KODI device

-  Run tvsort
::

    python tvsort_sl.py

- Error handling
	If you get the
	::
		Proses already running
	error message after the process was stuck (or any other reason) and you are sure that there isn't a process that
	is already running, you can manually remove the 'dummy.txt' file from the 'TV_PATH' folder and than try again to run the process
